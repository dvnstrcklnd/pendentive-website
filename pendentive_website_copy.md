### Hero Section

**Headline:**
Technology strategy for R&D that expands what scientists can do

**Intro paragraph:**
In architecture, a pendentive is the structural innovation that allows a circular dome to rest on a square base—a smooth transition between incompatible geometries. In R&D, the challenge is similar: laboratory methods, data systems, manufacturing processes, and AI models each have their own logic, and making them work together requires more than technical integration.

**Statement:**
We help organizations invest in technology that genuinely expands human capability—not just automation that substitutes for it.

### Philosophy

**Section title:** Philosophy

Most technology investments in R&D are evaluated by what they automate: How many experiments can run unattended? How much human labor can we remove?

We ask a different question: *What can scientists do now that they couldn't do before?*

The distinction matters. Technologies that merely substitute for human effort often create what economists call "so-so automation"—systems that displace workers without generating commensurate new value. The best investments create genuine usefulness: they extend reach into new experimental territory, surface patterns humans couldn't perceive, make distributed expertise accessible, amplify judgment under complexity, and help reasoning accumulate rather than dissipate.

We help clients distinguish between these possibilities and invest in the latter.

### Services

**Section title:** Services

**AI and Data Strategy**
Identifying where AI and data infrastructure genuinely add value in R&D—and where they don't. We help organizations avoid hype, evaluate vendor claims critically, and build roadmaps aligned to scientific and business goals.

**Integration Architecture**
Connecting laboratory systems, data platforms, manufacturing processes, and analytical tools in ways that reduce friction and preserve information. Using frameworks like Domain-Driven Design to align technical architecture with how science actually gets done.

**Technical Due Diligence**
Evaluating technology investments, vendor solutions, and internal proposals for scientific plausibility, implementation risk, and genuine usefulness. Particularly relevant for AI, automation, and data infrastructure in life sciences and adjacent fields.

**Fractional Leadership**
Interim and fractional executive roles for organizations navigating complex technology transitions. Engagement-based leadership for initiatives spanning science, technology, and operations.

**Dimensions of Machine Usefulness in Science**
*A framework for evaluating AI-enabled science by human capability expansion*

Existing frameworks for self-driving laboratories measure progress by how much human involvement can be removed. This essay proposes an alternative: measuring AI-enabled science by the new human capabilities it creates, not the human tasks it eliminates—and recognizing that these capabilities vary along multiple independent dimensions, not a single axis of autonomy.

### On Technology and Society

**Power and Progress: Our Thousand-Year Struggle Over Technology and Prosperity**
Daron Acemoglu and Simon Johnson
*The core argument: technological progress doesn't automatically produce broad-based prosperity. What matters is how technologies are deployed—whether they augment human capability and create new tasks, or merely substitute for labor without creating commensurate value.*

**AI as Normal Technology**
Henry Farrell and Cosma Shalizi
[Knight Columbia](https://knightcolumbia.org/content/ai-as-normal-technology)
*A skeptical, historically-grounded perspective on AI exceptionalism.*

**LLMs as a New Kind of Cultural Technology**
Alison Gopnik et al., Science (2025)
[PDF](https://henryfarrell.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Science-Accepted-Version.pdf)
*Large language models understood not as intelligent agents but as a new way to access accumulated human knowledge—analogous to writing, print, or markets.*

---

### On Organizations and Systems

**Team Topologies**
Matthew Skelton and Manuel Pais
*How to design team structures that align with system architecture. The key insight: organizational structure and technical architecture are not independent choices.*

**Domain-Driven Design**
Eric Evans
[Wikipedia overview](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design)
*Aligning software architecture with business domains. Essential for any integration work in complex organizations.*

---

### On Defense and Technology Policy

**The Pentagon's Brain: An Uncensored History of DARPA**
Annie Jacobsen
*How the institution that invented the internet, stealth aircraft, and GPS actually works—and how it fails.*

**Army of None: Autonomous Weapons and the Future of War**
Paul Scharre
*The clearest thinking I've encountered on autonomy, human judgment, and machine decision-making in high-stakes contexts.*

---

### On AI and Alignment

**The Alignment Problem: Machine Learning and Human Values**
Brian Christian
*A comprehensive survey of the challenges in making AI systems behave as intended. Useful background for anyone evaluating AI investments.*

---

### On Thinking and Communication

**Thinking, Fast and Slow**
Daniel Kahneman
*The foundational text on cognitive biases and the two-systems model of human reasoning. Essential for understanding why smart people make predictable mistakes.*

**Supercommunicators: How to Unlock the Secret Language of Connection**
Charles Duhigg
