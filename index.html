        <h1>Technology strategy for R&D that expands what scientists can do</h1>
        <p class="hero-intro">
            In architecture, a pendentive is the structural innovation that allows a circular dome to rest on a square base—a smooth transition between incompatible geometries. In biotech R&D, laboratory methods, data systems, manufacturing processes, and AI models each have their own logic. Mmaking them work together requires thoughtful integration.
        </p>
        <p class="hero-statement">
            We help organizations build integrated R&D systems that work as a unified whole.

                <h3>AI and Data Strategy</h3>
                <p>Identifying where AI and data infrastructure genuinely add value in R&D—and where they don't. We help organizations avoid hype, evaluate vendor claims critically, and build roadmaps aligned to scientific and business goals.</p>

                <h3>Integration Architecture</h3>
                <p>Connecting laboratory systems, data platforms, manufacturing processes, and analytical tools in ways that reduce friction and preserve information. Using frameworks like Domain-Driven Design to align technical architecture with how science actually gets done.</p>

                <h3>Technical Due Diligence</h3>
                <p>Evaluating technology investments, vendor solutions, and internal proposals for scientific plausibility, implementation risk, and genuine usefulness. Particularly relevant for AI, automation, and data infrastructure in life sciences and adjacent fields.</p>
