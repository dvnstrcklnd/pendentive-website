                In architecture, a pendentive is the structural innovation that allows a circular dome to rest on a square base—a smooth transition between incompatible geometries.

            <p class="hero-text">
                In biotech R&D, <strong>laboratory methods, data systems, manufacturing processes, and AI models</strong> each have their own logic. Making them work together requires thoughtful integration.

                <h3>AI and Data Strategy</h3>
                <p>Identifying where AI and data infrastructure genuinely add value in R&D—and where they don't. We help organizations avoid hype, evaluate vendor claims critically, and build roadmaps aligned to scientific and business goals.</p>

            <div class="service-item">
                <h3>Integration Architecture</h3>
                <p>Connecting laboratory systems, data platforms, manufacturing processes, and analytical tools in ways that reduce friction and preserve information. Using frameworks like Domain-Driven Design to align technical architecture with how science actually gets done.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="service-item">
                <h3>Technical Due Diligence</h3>
                <p>Evaluating technology investments, vendor solutions, and internal proposals for scientific plausibility, implementation risk, and genuine usefulness. Particularly relevant for AI, automation, and data infrastructure in life sciences and adjacent fields.</p>
