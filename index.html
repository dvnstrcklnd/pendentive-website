        <h1>Technology strategy for R&D that expands what scientists can do</h1>
        <p class="hero-intro">
            In architecture, a pendentive is the structural innovation that allows a circular dome to rest on a square base—a smooth transition between incompatible geometries. In R&D, the challenge is similar: laboratory methods, data systems, manufacturing processes, and AI models each have their own logic, and making them work together requires more than technical integration.
        </p>
        <p class="hero-statement">
            We help organizations invest in technology that genuinely expands human capability—not just automation that substitutes for it.

        <h2>Philosophy</h2>
        <p>Most technology investments in R&D are evaluated by what they automate: How many experiments can run unattended? How much human labor can we remove?</p>
        <p>We ask a different question: <em>What can scientists do now that they couldn't do before?</em></p>
        <p>The distinction matters. Technologies that merely substitute for human effort often create what economists call "so-so automation"—systems that displace workers without generating commensurate new value. The best investments create genuine usefulness: they extend reach into new experimental territory, surface patterns humans couldn't perceive, make distributed expertise accessible, amplify judgment under complexity, and help reasoning accumulate rather than dissipate.</p>
        <p>We help clients distinguish between these possibilities and invest in the latter.</p>

                <h3>AI and Data Strategy</h3>
                <p>Identifying where AI and data infrastructure genuinely add value in R&D—and where they don't. We help organizations avoid hype, evaluate vendor claims critically, and build roadmaps aligned to scientific and business goals.</p>

            <div class="service-item">
                <h3>Integration Architecture</h3>
                <p>Connecting laboratory systems, data platforms, manufacturing processes, and analytical tools in ways that reduce friction and preserve information. Using frameworks like Domain-Driven Design to align technical architecture with how science actually gets done.</p>

                <h3>Technical Due Diligence</h3>
                <p>Evaluating technology investments, vendor solutions, and internal proposals for scientific plausibility, implementation risk, and genuine usefulness. Particularly relevant for AI, automation, and data infrastructure in life sciences and adjacent fields.</p>

                <h3>Fractional Leadership</h3>
                <p>Interim and fractional executive roles for organizations navigating complex technology transitions. Engagement-based leadership for initiatives spanning science, technology, and operations.</p>
